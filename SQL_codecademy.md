### Usage Funnels

A funnel is a set of corresponding data collection.
E.g:
a survey --> customer_visits --> customer_purchases
OR
web_browsers --> no_of_checkouts --> no_of_purchases


the three different datasets can be combined to observe trends and draw conclusions.

For example, after joining the three tables (browse, checkout, purchase) and their data:
- You can further condense the data to calculate browse-to-checkout & checkout-to-purchase ratios.
- You can observe trends between these ratios and certain dates i.e. the lead up to Christmas
- & more
