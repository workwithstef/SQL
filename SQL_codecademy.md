### Usage Funnels

A funnel is a marketing model which illustrates the theoretical customer journey towards the purchase of a product or service.

Usually illustrated by a set of corresponding data collection.
E.g:
a survey with sequential questions and user responses
OR
web_browsers --> no_of_checkouts --> no_of_purchases

Generally, we want to know the total number of users in each step of the funnel, as well as the percent of users who complete each step.

the three different datasets can be combined to observe trends and draw conclusions.

For example, after joining the three tables (browse, checkout, purchase) and their data:
- You can further condense the data to calculate browse-to-checkout & checkout-to-purchase ratios.
- You can observe trends between these ratios and certain dates i.e. the lead up to Christmas
- & more
